# 0DInterglacialModel

In this repository you will find a model made in an attempt to recreate glacial-interglacial cycles in a 0D model. This project was started by Luc Bohn and Ivo Goede in oktober 2020 under supervision of W.J. van de Berg at Utrecht University. Feel free to adapt and use this code in any way for your own purposes. 

The repo contains a script called "GlobeModel" for simulating a very simple earth model in 0D using the equations as posed in the project, the "Hypercube_sampling" script is used to optimize parameters as in put for such a simulation

# 0DInterglacialModel

In this repository you will find a model made in an attempt to recreate glacial-interglacial cycles in a 0D model. This project was started by Luc Bohn and Ivo Goede in oktober 2020 
under supervision of W.J. van de Berg at Utrecht University. Feel free to adapt and use this code in any way for your own purposes.
